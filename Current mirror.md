# **CURRENT MIRROR**
## Aim
Design and analyze the given current mirror circuit with the following specifications:
- **Voltage Gain (Av) > 10 V/V**
- **Supply Voltage (Vdd) = 1.8V**
- **Power Consumption (P) <= 1W**
- **Consider three cases for channel length (L):**
  - **L = 180 nm,500nm,1000nm**
  - keeping the ratio (W/L) same for all the cases.

## Theory

## 📘 What is a Current Mirror?

A **Current Mirror** is a circuit that copies a reference current (Iref) into one or more output branches. It ensures that the output current stays constant and is proportional to the reference current, even if the load changes.
## 📐 Current Ratios Explained

We explore two cases:
- **1:1 Mirror**: Output current (Iout) = Iref
- **1:2 Mirror**: Output current (Iout) = 2 × Iref

This is achieved by adjusting the **W/L ratios** (Width/Length) of the MOSFETs:
| Transistor | W/L Ratio | Current |
|------------|------------|---------|
| M1 (Reference) | 1 | Iref |
| M2 (Output - 1:1) | 1 | Iref |
| M2 (Output - 1:2) | 2 | 2 × Iref |

Current Mirrors are particularly useful in the integrated circuits, for biasing the amplifiers. The advantage of biasing the amplifiers with the current source is that it provides a high voltage gain and good biasing stability. This current source can be generated using a simple PMOS transistor or using a MOS transistor in cascode configuration (to achieve higher gain)
###Key Characteristics of a Current Mirror:

Maintains constant current irrespective of load variations.
Provides high output impedance.
Ensures precise current replication across outputs.

## Calculation

### Given:
- **Supply Voltage**: V<sub>dd</sub> = 1.8V  
- **Power Consumption**: P ≤ 1mW  

### Total Current:
### Ratio 1:1
```math
I_t = \frac{P}{V_{DD}} = \frac{1mW}{1.8V} = 0.555mA
I_{ref} = \frac{I_t}{2} = 0.2778mA
```

- The measured **-3dB voltage gain (Av) = 27.6 dB**

### Inference for L = 1 μm
- The highest gain is observed in the **L = 1 μm** case, particularly for the 1:2 ratio.
- The transient response confirms proper signal amplification.
- Increasing L increases gain due to reduced short-channel effects and higher output resistance.

## Comparison Table for L = 1 μm
| Parameter | 1:1 Ratio (L = 1 μm) | 1:2 Ratio (L = 1 μm) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Id (A)** | 0.000277 | 0.00037 |
| **-3dB Gain (dB)** | 20.3 | 27.6 |

## Inference
- Comparing all gain values, we observe that the gain increases as the channel length (L) increases. The highest gain is seen in the **L = 1 μm** case, confirming that longer channel lengths contribute to improved voltage gain.
- The increase in L results in **better current mirroring** due to reduced short-channel effects and increased output resistance. This leads to a more stable and accurate current replication.
- The **1:2 ratio consistently provides higher gain** compared to the 1:1 ratio due to the increase in transconductance (gm), which enhances the amplification capability.
- **Transient Analysis Comparison:**
  - As we compare the transient analysis waveforms across different values of L, we observe that the **width of the sine wave increases** when L is increased.
  - This occurs because **the transient response becomes slower** with increasing L. The increased channel length results in **higher output resistance**, which leads to **lower bandwidth** and a longer time constant for circuit response.
  - The slower transient response means that the circuit takes more time to settle to steady-state values, which can be seen as a widening of the waveform in the time domain.
  - This behavior is expected since **a higher L leads to lower drain-source conductance (gds), reducing the speed at which current changes in response to voltage variations**.

### Result
| Parameter | 1:1 Ratio (L = 180 nm) | 1:2 Ratio (L = 180 nm) | 1:1 Ratio (L = 500 nm) | 1:2 Ratio (L = 500 nm) | 1:1 Ratio (L = 1 μm) | 1:2 Ratio (L = 1 μm) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Id (A)** | 0.0002769 | 0.00037 | 0.000274 | 0.00037 | 0.000277 | 0.00037 |
| **-3dB Gain (dB)** | 17.5 | 21 | 17.5 | 18.6 | 20.3 | 27.6 |

- From the table, we confirm that  **generaly both Id and gain improve as L increases**, validating the theoretical expectations of current mirroring performance with longer channel lengths.
- Additionally, the **slower transient response at higher L values** indicates a trade-off between gain and speed, which should be considered in practical circuit designs.
